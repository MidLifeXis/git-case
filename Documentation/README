# Implementation

## General

Few points about implementation...

 * code uses .git/case/index for temporary index
 * code uses .git/case/active for current case
 * code uses .git/case/tmp/ for temporary scratch space
 * code uses 'cases' branch to create history for cases

## Datastore

In the 'cases' branch, git-case stores each case in it's own directory.
The directory contains all information about the case.  Each change to
the case creates a new commit on the 'cases' branch.

    <id>/               # directory per case
    |-- description     # 1st line title, then free form description
    |-- type            # bug/feature/question/...
    |-- found           # git commit worktree was in when case created RO
    |-- state           # new/open/invalid/etc
    |-- assigned        # name <email>
    |-- marks/          # list of marks - tags in most tracker talk
    |   `-- <name>      # empty file
    |-- comments/       # comments, one per file
    |   `-- <sha1>      # contains arbitrary text
    |-- files/          # attachements to the case/comment
    |   `-- <filename>/ # the name of the dir is actually the name of the file
    |       `-- <sha1>  # hash of the file, contais the file
    |-- good-ids/       # IDs in source where this was not an issue
    |   `-- <sha1>      # empty file
    |-- bad-ids/        # IDs in source where this was a bug
    |   `-- <sha1>      # empty file
    `-- fields/         # additional fields
        `-- <name>      # contains one line of text
